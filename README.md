## Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

#Introduction

Customer churn has become a major problem in banking industry and banks have always tried to track customer interaction with the company to detect early warning signs in customer’s behavior. Marketing literature states that it is more costly to engage a new customer than to retain an existing loyal customer (Sharma & Kumar Panigrahi, 2011). Khan et al. (2010) state that cost of obtaining new customers is five times higher than retaining existing customers. Therefore, banks need to shift their attention from customer acquisition to customer retention, provide accurate prediction models, and effective churn prediction strategies as customer retention solution, to prevent churn.
This project aims to present machine learning models that can be used to predict which customers are most likely to churn and how long (years) the customer will stay with the bank.


#Objectives

-To predict if a bank’s customers will churn or stay with the bank.

-To predict how many years would a customer stay with the bank.
